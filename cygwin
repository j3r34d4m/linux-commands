# I converted to domain from local user, but did not have to remove and recreate the cyg_server
# I left the cyg_server local user running the sshd service
# 
# 1. bring the domain user into /etc/passwd (mkpasswd -c > /etc/passwd)
# 2. re-run ssh-host-config according to link 2 above (start cygwin term as admin)
#    strict modes -> yes
#    privilege separation -> yes
# 3. re-run ssh-user-config (start cygwin term as user)
