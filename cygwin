# I converted to domain from local user, all  i had to do was 
# bring the domain user into /etc/passwd (mkpasswd -c > /etc/passwd)
# re-run ssh-host-config according to link 2 above (start cygwin term as admin)
# re-run ssh-user-config (start cygwin term as user)

# sshd is still running under original local cyg_server user
# I don't know if the machine starts out under domain control if the above would be possible under IT controls
